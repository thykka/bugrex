<p>Use Bugrex.com is at your own risk. </p>
<p>Bugrex is an experiment launched during a hackathon by two geeks in Oslo, Norway. We do not take any responsibility for any negative effects that you may get from chatting to one of our experts. Sometimes we are the experts, sometimes it's freelancers that we get to know that earn 80% of the price paid. We don't recommend you leave to sensitive information to the experts, including proprietary source code.</p>

<p>We are writing this short Terms of Use, just to cover our ass, but we hope people won't be scared of it, and that most people will find it useful. The only goal we have is to make it simpler to get instant help from a developer. </p>
