          <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
          <p>Googling to solve a problem is a not always the easiest. Sometimes it's really nice to be able to instantly talk to a real person about your problems. Whether that is to ask the newbie questions you don't dare to ask other places, let an expert teach you something you don't fully understand, or let the expert fix annoying bugs. You simply start chatting with a person, the first 3 minutes are free. After that it's $10 per 20 minutes. We recommend you try the chat, and experience what it's like.</p>
          <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>I can't see the chat?</li>
            <p>That chat is supposed to be on the right on desktop/tablet and on the very bottom on mobile. If it's not something is wrong. The best suggestion is to disable your adblocker. We're currently using Olarks excellent chat-service, but some people say it doesn't work if you have adblockers enabled. If it doesn't fix it, try another browser. If that doesn't fix it, we're happy if you send us an email to <a class="link" href="mailto:bugrex@bonito.no">bugrex@bonito.no</a></p>
            <li>How do I know I'm not talking to a robot?</li>
            <p>Try it out :)</p>
            <li>When do I pay?</li>
            <p>After the first free 3 minutes are over, we'll send you an direct link, so you can pay $10 for 20 minutes to the experts Paypal-account. If you want to talk longer, you'll pay again to the same link. Basicly expert will tell you the details about payments.</p>
            <li>Is it only over chat?</li>
            <p>It's up to you and the expert. If you want to talk over voice or video, the expert might send you a link, so you can talk there. But all communication starts with the chat.</p>
            <li>Can I become an expert?</li>
            <p>If you're interested in working an expert, hit the 'Become an Expert' button in the top left corner of the site.</p>
            <li>Who are you?</li>
            <p>We are a startup from Norway who believe it should be an easier way to talk to another dev whenever you want to. Sometimes it's just better to talk to a real person, than to try consuming all the information that Google gives you. Talking to a real person is actually pretty good. If you have questions you can contact us at <a class="link" href="mailto:bugrex@bonito.no">bugrex@bonito.no</a>.
