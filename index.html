	<p>BugRex is where your bugs and software issues come to die. We instantly hook you up with someone who knows how to fix your issue, so that you can continue on with your project.</p>
	<p>It's risk free. If your problem doesn't get fixed, you pay nothing.</p>
	<p>If it gets fixed, you only pay what you think it was worth. Our suggested price for a ten minute fix is 10 USD. </p>
	<p>As for now, we can only help you with Javascript related problems, but we plan to expand to other issues in the future.</p>
